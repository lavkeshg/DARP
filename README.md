: Dial-a-Ride problem instances solve pickup and drop-off scheduling and trip assignment problem. This approach follows a *tabu heuristic* search algorithm to find the sub-optimal solution. This is an efficient of solving the problem considering the original MIP problem becomes increasingly difficult to solve under all scenarios.
